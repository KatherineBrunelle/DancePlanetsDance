Devon Hills and Kate Brunelle's final project for Dr. Ayat Hatem's 
Computing 4 class at the University of Massachusetts Lowell, Spring 2016.

The project is to create a universe simulator, which takes in a .txt file
that gives the coordinates, images, and the sizes of the system's 
SpaceObjects. This information will be used with Newton's equation for
gravity to simulate the orbits of the bodies. We will use C++ and the 
SFML libraries to create the simulation.
